# Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm for Path Optimization in Python

This is an optimizer which tries to optimize a path on a virtual terrain in regards to energy consumption.
It works by creating simple creatures which contain a brain which is modeled as a very simple neural network.
The training process works by generating a population of creatures which we get by randomly modifying and combining the parameters inside the neural networks of the previous generation.
